Requirements:
- Ignore case and spaces.
Example:
Input: 'Racecar'
Output: True


# Fibonacci Sequence Generator -
Write a Python function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Requirements:
- Use a for loop.
- The function should return the sequence as a list.
Example:
Input: 5
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]


# Factorial Calculation -
Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
Requirements:
- Validate that the input is a non-negative integer.
Example:
Input: 5
Output: 120


# Prime Number Checker -
Write a Python program that checks if a given number is a prime number.
Requirements:
- Use a for loop for checking divisibility.
- Return True if the number is prime, otherwise False.
Example:
Input: 7
Output: True


# File Word Counter -
Write a Python program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it.
Requirements:
- Use file handling to open and read the file.
- Return the total word count.
Example:
Input file content: 'Hello world! Welcome to Python.'
Output: 5


# List Sorting without Built-in Functions -
Write a Python program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order without using the sorted()
function.
Requirements:
- Use a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort.
- Return the sorted list.
Example:
Input: [4, 2, 9, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 9]


# Dictionary Key Search -
Write a Python program that checks if a given key exists in a dictionary.
Requirements:
- Use a for loop to check the presence of the key.
- Return True if the key exists, otherwise False.
Example:
Input: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, key: 'b'
Output: True
